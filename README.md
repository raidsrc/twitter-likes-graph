# raidsrc's Twitter Likes Graph

[Deployed here.](https://twitter-likes-graph.vercel.app/)

I had COVID-19 in mid-August 2022 and was bored and tired and stuck at home recovering. So I decided to fetch a big 'ol dataset of 20k tweets from the Twitter Developers API and plot the tweets on a histogram, as well as write a bunch of explanations for how I did everything. 

dependencies: NextJS, Victory, Framer Motion, d3, React

Prior to writing this web app, I'd never used Framer Motion or Victory. I had to teach myself to use 'em. Proud of myself for that.
